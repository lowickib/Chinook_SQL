  customer_id, 
  TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', invoice_date), 'YYYY-MM') AS invoice_month,
  SUM(total) AS total_spendings
FROM invoice
GROUP BY customer_id, TO_CHAR(DATE_TRUNC('month', invoice_date), 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY invoice_month
)

SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS customer,
